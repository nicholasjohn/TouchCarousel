TouchCarousel
============

A jQuery Carousel implementation with touch/swipe features.


Project Files
-------------

The below table summarises the contents of each file throughout the structure of TouchCarousel:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=2>/CSS</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <em>custom.css</em>
    </td>
    <td>
      Where custom stylings are kept. You should replace these with 
      your styles, or implement them into your own site's stylesheets.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <em>styles.css</em>
    </td>
    <td>
      Generic styling for the TouchCarousel
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  
  <tr>
    <th colspan=2>/JS</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <em>touch-carousel.js</em>
    </td>
    <td>
      This is the JavaScript file which runs your carousel! It should be 
      included as a script tag <strong>after</strong> your jQuery include.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th colspan=2>HTML</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <em>index.html</em>
    </td>
    <td>
      Hopefully this is quite well documented, but you'll be needing the contents of <strong>.touch-carousel</strong>
      <br>
      <em>Note: <strong>.js-carousel</strong> is also needed on this container for jQuery targeting to work</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
</table>
